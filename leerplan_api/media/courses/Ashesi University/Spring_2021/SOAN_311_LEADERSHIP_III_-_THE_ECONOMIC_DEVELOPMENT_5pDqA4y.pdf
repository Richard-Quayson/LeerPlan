{"code": "SOAN 311", "name": "LEADERSHIP III - THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF A GOOD SOCIETY", "description": "Leadership III seeks to challenge reflective thinking on what constitutes a \u201cgood society\u201d and how best economic activity could be organized to realize it. How do we best achieve a balance of liberty, efficiency, equality, and community? At the end of this seminar series, students should have a better understanding of the interplay between natural and civic rights on the one hand and sustainable economic activity on the other. The aim is not to achieve consensus among participants as much as to get students to appreciate the tensions among various elements of the good society and why even within a predominantly capitalist democratic society, people may disagree and pursue differing philosophies.", "semester": {"name": "Spring", "year": 2021}, "instructors": [{"name": "Dr. Stephen Armah", "email": "searmah@ashesi.edu.gh", "office_hours": [{"day": "TBA", "time": null}], "phone": null}], "faculty_interns": [{"name": "Earl-Philips Otibo-Addo", "email": null, "office_hours": [], "phone": "+233 (0) 302610330.
