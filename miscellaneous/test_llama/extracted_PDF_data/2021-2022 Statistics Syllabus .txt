COURSE DESCRIPTION 
What influences consumer choice? What life-style changes lead to better health 
and longevity? What factors influence Africans’ views on social and political 
issues? Are you interested in understanding how climate change is impacting 
communities in your home country? How can the vast amount of data collected 
and stored online be used to improve our quality of life? The discipline of 
statistics seeks to turn data into useful information that can help answer these 
and many other questions that may pique your interest.  
 
In this course, learning statistics will be motivated by using real data to answer 
questions that YOU are passionate about. Each student will: (1) generate a 
testable hypothesis based on secondary data; (2) understand how large 
datasets are structured; (3) format and manage data; (4) conduct descriptive 
and inferential statistical analysis; and (5) communicate the results of their 
research to expert and novice audiences. The process of converting data into 
useful information draws on the following set of introductory statistical skills 
taught in the course: 
• Producing data 
• Exploratory data analysis 
• Probability 
• Inference 
Statistical computing software is the essential tool that ties the quantitative 
research process together. In this course, you will use R and R Studio to 
manage data, describe data, analyse data and display data – all in the service 
of answering your own interesting research question!

INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES 
1. This course employs a “flipped classroom” approach. Students will use 
Carnegie Melon University’s Open Learning Initiative (OLI) Probability 
and Statistics online course to learn key statistical concepts and 
procedures before class. Scheduled class times will further develop 
statistical concepts, procedures, and coding skills through applications 
and simulations and also allow time for work on students’ own research 
projects. 
2. This course takes advantage of three current best practices in university 
teaching (1) a ‘do-learn’ approach; (2) opportunities to employ self-
regulated learning strategies and develop skills in meta-cognition 
(thinking about one’s own thinking and learning processes); and (3) real 
world application of learning based on students’ own interests. 
3. The instructional team aims to provide a supportive learning environment 
for students to drive their own learning, take risks, make mistakes, and 
get the most out of the course experience. 
 
ASHESI LEARNING GOALS 
1. Curious & Skilled: An Ashesi student is inquisitive, confident, has a 
breadth of knowledge, and has attained a high level of mastery in his/her 
chosen field. The study of statistics encourages students to wonder about 
the story behind the data and offers a process and set of skills to answer 
questions that they are curious about. In this course, students will 
generate their own research questions to motivate the desire to gain skills 
in statistical analysis. 
2. Critical Thinking & Quantitative Reasoning: An Ashesi student is able 
to apply critical thinking and quantitative reasoning to approach complex 
problems. Statistical reasoning is essential to the quantitative research 
process, while other critical thinking skills, such as identifying reliable and 
un-reliable sources of information, play an important role. Homework 
assignments and the course project will give students the chance to 
practice and receive feedback on these skills. 
3. Communication: An Ashesi student is an excellent communicator in a 
variety of forms. A command of the conventions for communicating the 
outcomes of statistical analysis is essential to ethical and transparent 
reporting of the results of quantitative research. Course assessments will 
emphasize both the outcomes of statistical analysis as well as the 
conventions for accurately communicating the results. The final project 
presentation gives students the opportunity to communicate the results of 
their research in the form of an academic poster. 
4. Technology: An Ashesi student is an effective and flexible user of 
technology. In the era of the internet and big data, statistical computing 
and data management are essential skills required in many disciplines. 
Students will develop competence in statistical computing and data 
management by completing coursework and assessments using R and R 
Studio. 
 
EVALUATION CRITERIA 
Course grades will be determined by the following weighted assessments: 
15% OLI Content, Activities & Checkpoints 
15% Homework Assignments 
20% Mid-semester Exam 
10% Project Assignments 
40% Final Assessment 
• Statistics Poster Presentation and Report  
 
 
TYPES OF ASSESSMENT AND THEIR PURPOSE 
OLI Content, Activities & Checkpoints (15% - approx. 3 hours per week):  
Between one and three OLI modules are assigned each week. Assigned 
modules will take approximately three hours to complete. Modules involve 
reading and watching short videos, Learn by Doing activities, Did I Get 
This? multiple choice and short response questions, and Checkpoint 
quizzes. 
The OLI site is where you will first encounter statistics concepts and 
procedures; the module activities should be completed before coming to 
class. In-class activities will build on content covered online. OLI 
MATERIAL WILL NOT BE REPEATED IN CLASS.  
OLI Checkpoints are graded quizzes. You will have two chances to take 
each OLI Checkpoint quiz with the best score accepted as the quiz grade. 
NOTE: Progress on the OLI modules are tracked in the OLI Dashboard. 
You can monitor your own learning from the OLI Dashboard; faculty and 
FIs will track your progress and assign grades for (1) percent completed 
in each module and (2) Checkpoint quiz scores. 
Percentage complete on assigned OLI modules (includes all activities) and 
scores on module Checkpoints are downloaded Monday morning at 
8:00 am. 
 
Homework Assignments (15% - approx. 4 hours to complete):  
Homework assignments are to be done individually. Assignments 
are designed to take approximately four hours to complete. Homework 
assignments will help students connect the application of statistics to 
different disciplines, reinforce concepts learned in OLI and in class, and 
help students gain the R coding skills they will need for their research 
projects.  
Homework assignments will be completed using R and RStudio and 
submitted electronically using the RMarkdown document format. 
Homework expectations: 
• Students can discuss homework questions and possible approaches 
with FIs, peers and study groups and in Statistics Open Lab. 
• Do not share coding files or images of worked problems in 
electronic or other form.  
• Do not submit assigned problems to homework help 
websites.  
• Do not refer to submitted work or drafts from previous year 
groups. 
Homework assignments are due on Thursday night at 11:59 pm. 
Assignments submitted up to one day late are accepted with a one grade 
level reduction. Assignments beyond one day late are not accepted. 
 
Mid-Semester Exam (20%) 
The mid-semester exam will cover producing data, exploratory data analysis 
and probability. 
 
Research Project (10% Project Assignments + 40% Poster Presentation and 
report):  
You will work on your individual research project throughout the 
semester. The research project will be completed as a series of six Project 
Assignments designed to step you through the cycle of quantitative 
research. The assignments also give you a chance to receive feedback 
and make changes along the way in order to produce your best work.  
The final product of the research is an academic poster through which 
you will demonstrate a command of the conventions of statistical 
communication, including visual displays and textual summaries, and the 
ability to interpret the results of your research to both academic and non-
expert audiences. 
Use of project work in any form from previous year groups is considered 
plagiarism and a violation of Ashesi University’s guidelines on academic 
integrity. 
 
 
 
 
TIME MANAGEMENT 
Attention and time management are the keys to success in learning and life! 
This course will help you build a strong work ethic by consistently requiring 
between 6 and 10 hours per week of study outside of the scheduled class times. 
Planning and writing down regularly scheduled study times into your weekly 
planner, sticking to your schedule and eliminating distractions, will go a long 
way toward ensuring you achieve the best possible learning outcomes in the 
course. 
 
STATISTICS OPEN LAB 
Rather than structured discussion sessions, you will have the opportunity to 
attend twice weekly Statistics Open Lab staffed with two faculty interns. During 
Statistics Open Lab students can received assistance with OLI, statistics 
concepts, coding in R, project work as well as tips or hints on homework 
questions. 
 
PASS MARK 
Statistics is a prerequisite for Quantitative Methods which comes in the second 
semester of the second year at Ashesi. A pass mark of D+ in Statistics with 
Probability is required for students to register for Quantitative Methods. 
 
CLASSROOM ETIQUETTE 
In order to maintain a respectful classroom environment that offers all 
students the best opportunity to learn, the following standards of classroom 
etiquette are expected: 
• Mobile phones turned off. University policy dictates a 30 GH fee 
payable to the Dean of Students for any incidence of phone ringing in 
the classroom. Students are not to leave the classroom for the purpose 
of answering the phone or responding to messages 
• Arrive on time; tardiness is disruptive, disrespectful, and wastes 
valuable learning time 
• The course requires students to use personal and lab computers in 
class; students need to stay focused on assigned tasks and avoid 
distractions on the computers 
• Never laugh at or criticize student contributions or presentations; 
questions to colleagues should be non-judgemental, constructive, and 
relevant 
• Leaving and entering the lecture hall unnecessarily (for example to 
purchase drinks or answer the phone) is disruptive to the learning 
atmosphere 
 
 
TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS  
A personal laptop with R and R Studio installed is necessary for the course. 
Students should attend class with their laptop each day. Activities involving 
coding will take place on most class days. Instructions will be sent via e-mail for 
students to install the necessary software and setup personal laptops.
