COURSE DESCRIPTION: Welcome to Principles of Economics. This course is an exciting introduction 
to the field of economics, with application to the local African and Ghanaian context. Economics has two 
main divisions: microeconomics and macroeconomics.  We will first tackle the microeconomics topics and 
then move on to the macroeconomics topics, but both set of topics are equally pertinent.  After a general 
introduction to the field of economics and explaining the difference between microeconomics and 
macroeconomics, the course will start by delving into microeconomic theory before finishing up with 
macroeconomics theory. Traditional microeconomic topics that will be treated include the concept of the 
invisible hand and the role of incentives in the market; supply and demand; international trade; demand and 
supply, elasticity; taxation, and the implications of government policy for individual firms. For the section 
on macroeconomics, we will discuss simple models of goods and services, assets, capital, and labour 
markets which can be usefully applied to generate realistic predictions regarding the behaviour of such 
macroeconomic variables as: output and growth; employment; inflation; the current account; as well as 
interest and exchange rates. The course will teach students to use these models to understand and interpret 
current and historical macroeconomic developments. Macroeconomic developments such as the effects of 
the COVID 19 pandemic, global inflation related to rising oil prices and the geopolitical conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine and possible impacts of national debt and corruption on macroeconomic stability and 
performance of African countries like Ghana will be discussed. The role of the IMF in helping countries to 
manage economic challenges will be assessed.  Finally, currency crises periodically plaguing Anglophone 
African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria that are not part of any monetary union will be discussed. 
 
Teaching style: Apart from lecturers, this class will use in-class assignments. small group discussions, 
student led discussions, student presentations, class debates, analysis of short videos viewed in class and 
reviews of assigned journal articles.  The course is designed to be very interactive with a focus on student 
participation. 
 
Note: Class material such as notes, articles, policy briefs, guides to assignments and links to videos will be 
accessible via Canvas and final grades will be available via CAMU.  Make sure you are registered on both 
platforms.  Official university recognition of registration for the course is by CAMU registration.

COURSE OBJECTIVES/LEARNING OUTCOMES:  
   
The primary goal of this course is to help students develop an understanding of the market economy 
as a whole and of the actions of the different players within the market economy such as consumers and 
firms.  The course will help students to appreciate and deal with the ubiquitous problem of scarcity in 
production in addition to explaining the actions of consumers and firms because of scarcity from a 
microeconomic perspective and the behavior of the economy from a macroeconomic perspective in an 
increasingly globalized and interconnected world. 
  
In delivering the course we aim to guide students to be able to make informed decision in production 
and consumption from an economic perspective by always considering the real cost (or the opportunity cost) 
of decisions, currency depreciation and time value of money. It is also vital for students to be able to identify 
the unintended consequences that incentives inherent in decisions taken imply. 
   
The skills gained from the course will be useful in executing projects created in the fields of 
Management Information Systems (MIS), Computer Science, Engineering, and other STEM fields by 
enabling an understanding of costs, pricing, and the effect of the economic environment on the marketing 
and supply chain of products designed in these STEM fields. The course will help students to consume 
information derived from databases and from news outlets that pertain to the local and global economy and 
to make correct inferences from these pieces of information. We also aim to assist students to develop an 
BA DEPARTMENT  
  
        Page 3 of 10  
  
  
understanding of the workings of macroeconomic policy and to familiarise students with the interpretation 
of macroeconomic and monetary data. We encourage students to use the tools provided in the class activities 
and lectures to gain a better understanding of current global macroeconomic events and trends as well as 
macroeconomic issues in Africa, Ghana and beyond. Weekly classes, assignments, exams, and projects will 
consolidate the understanding and interpretation of macroeconomic data.  
 
 
 
Intended Learning Outcomes:

The Government Debt Debate: - Group Assignment.  To be counted as part of HW (HW 3) 
 The African Experience leading to HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Country); historical global debt default in 
Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Africa; Africa’s increasing indebtedness to China and the role of IMF 
There is an ongoing debate in the economics literature as to whether it is a good idea for developed and 
developing countries especially, African countries to take on large amounts of debt, and how much debt is 
enough? There is also a debate as to whether increasing African indebtedness to China reflects a new form 
of colonization and whether the IMF does some good by helping African countries manage their debt despite 
IMF’s often unhealthy reputation in development economics as a loan shark. The problems of rising national 
debt are not new. Historically, rising national debt often heralds financial crisis and led to defaults of loan 
payments in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and Africa leading to the unpopular Structural Adjustment 
Programs (SAPs) and for the case of African countries like Ghana, several defaults within the same country. 
The SAPs designed to help African countries pay back their loans were unpopular because apart from 
limiting funding for social programs in health and education, they restricted wanton and profligate 
government expenditure and imposed conditionalities on African economies. 
 
To put the debate in proper context, remember that countries take on debt because they cannot finance all the 
projects and activities, they intend to do in a year with current revenues so they must borrow from different 
sources, but how much borrowing is too much borrowing?  The concept of national debt is a little different 
from the debt that private companies or individuals take on.  Unlike private firms and individuals who must 
pay back all loans from their own resources or profits or at a minimum provide collateral to cover their debt, 
the government of a country is unique because it takes on debt and pays back debt by taxing its citizens, 
from selling natural resources such as gold and oil (in the case of developing countries) or simply by 
printing money.  While citizens generally hate taxes and taxes make governments unpopular, the printing of 
money (termed seignorage in economics) leads to inflation and devalues the currency so national 
governments cannot tax citizens unreasonably or print money forever. 
 
 The Debate as to whether increasing national debt stalls development or not, and just how bad is a high 
level of government debt, divides opinion and depends on context. While some developed country 
BA DEPARTMENT  
  
        Page 6 of 10  
  
  
economists believe that national governments of developed countries can print money or raise taxes so they 
can in fact always print money or raise taxes to pay all debt, other developed country economists disagree 
and argue that high taxes reduce business activity and too much debt creates stress in the system and causes 
inflation which has dire consequences. The developed country economists in favor of high debt argue that if 
the economy that takes on the debt is productive, the debt will be paid back with no problem if the return on 
the debt I higher than its opportunity cost or the interest rate. In contrast most developing country 
economists and economists who work on developing countries tend to have a negative view of rising 
national debt (maybe because of fears of corruption or low productivity) and go as far as to suggest a level 
of the ratio of debt to GDP beyond which the national government must put a stop to borrowing.  So just 
how bad is rising national debt to an African country like Ghana? Historically it is known that rising debt 
has sent Ghana to seek help from the IMF on 17 different occasions with the last one in the current year of 
2022. Further, during the early tenure of President Kuffuor from 2000 to 2008, Ghana enjoyed the benefits 
of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative where a substantial amount of Ghana’s debt was 
forgiven after Ghana’s debt rose so high that the economy grounded to a halt. Growth followed HIPC 
although Ghana’s national debt also kept increasing until the debt has increased so high it is currently almost 
as big as the economy and is much higher than the levels that sent Ghana to HIPC. 
 
The principles of economics class will hold a debate between different assigned groups about whether it is 
worth is for a developing African country like Ghana to carry high levels of government debt? Is there a 
situation where high levels of debt can facilitate growth? Why does high national debt rather always lead to 
economic crisis and what must Ghana do to avoid economic crisis related to National Debt? 
  
Motion for the Debate: High and Increasing Government Debt is always deleterious for the economic 
outlook of Ghana so the Ghana Parliament must enact a law that forbids the government of Ghana from 
borrowing more than 20% of its GDP. 
 
Participation-(5% of total grade)-Group Assignment 
Attendance and participation are mandatory.  Student involvement in presentations, discussions as well as 
contributions and participation in lecturers will be closely monitored and graded.  
 
Academic Integrity  
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, 
plagiarism, falsifying identity, or academic records, and being an accessory to acts of academic dishonesty.  
Ignorance about what counts as plagiarism is not an acceptable excuse. Each student is required to maintain 
the standards of integrity set forth in the Ashesi University College Handbook.
